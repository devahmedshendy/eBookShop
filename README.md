# eBook Shop
This app helps user to view books for each category, and apply many operations like add, edit or delete.

## NOTES
> This app is made for learning purpose only.  

> I didn't give any attention to landscape mode while development, it is not disabled thought, and ContraintLayout was only used to advance my development skills using it.  

> This is an early stage for the application and only tested once or couple times, and as long as it is for learning purpose, I don't solve any bugs and - Inshaa Allah - I will go better in next new apps. But things work fine as showed in below demos.
